Switch Cases

In switch statement, you can jumpy to various cases based on your expression

Note:
- cases have to be the same types as expression, must be a constant or literal
- duplicate cases values are not allowed
- break is used to terminate the seq
- if break is not used, it will continue to the next case
- deafult will execute when none above does
- if default is not at the end, put break after it
