# lets understand the code in dept here

1. public class Main{}

- public -> means this class can be accessed anywhere or can be called in other files
- class Main - the name of the class is Main and it should same as the filename

2. public static void main
    - main -> it is the keyword that we have and it is important as it is a entry point of the program
    - public -> it is main function that we are executing so it has to be public so that it can be accessed 
    - static -> we can run this function without create the object of the Main class
    - void -> return type of the function
    - String[] args - it is a command line argument(data can be given through terminal itself) that accepts the array of string
                    and will be stored in args varibale
